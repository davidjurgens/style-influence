Style Influence
==============================

Linguistic style matching (LSM) in conversations can be reflective of several aspects of social influence such as power
or persuasion. However, how LSM relates to the outcomes of online communication on platforms such as Reddit is an unknown question.

In this study, we analyze a large corpus of two-party conversation threads in Reddit where we identify all occurrences of LSM 
using two types of style: the use of function words and formality. Using this framework, we examine how levels of LSM differ 
in conversations depending on several social factors within Reddit: post and subreddit features, conversation depth, user tenure, 
and the controversiality of a comment. Finally, we measure the change of LSM following loss of status after community banning.
Our findings reveal the interplay of LSM in Reddit conversations with several community metrics, suggesting the importance of 
understanding conversation engagement when understanding community dynamics.
